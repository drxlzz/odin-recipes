                <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 large russet potato, cut into evenly sized strips</li>
                    <li>2 cups vegetable oil for frying, or as needed</li>
                    <li>salt to taste</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Steps:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>First step:</strong></li>
                    Soak potato strips in a large bowl of water for about 30 minutes. Pat with paper towels until thoroughly dry.
                    <li><strong>Second step:</strong></li>
                    Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 275 degrees F (135 degrees C). Gently add potatoes to the hot oil and fry for about 5 minutes, stirring and flipping the potatoes occasionally. Use a slotted spoon to transfer potatoes to a paper towel-lined plate. Let cool completely.
                    <li><strong>Third step:</strong></li>
                    Heat oil again, but this time to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Add potatoes and fry a second time until golden brown, 5 to 6 minutes.
                    <li><strong>Final step:</strong></li>
                    Remove from the deep-fryer and blot with a paper towel. Sprinkle with salt to serve.
